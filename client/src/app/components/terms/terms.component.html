  <p>Dr. Melanie Hurst Nurse Practitioner (NPs) Informed Consent</p>
  <p>Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable 
    healthcare providers at different locations to share individual patient 
    medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. 
    Providers may include primary care physicians or practitioners, 
    specialists, and subspecialists. The information may be used for diagnosis, 
    therapy, follow-up, education and may include any of the following:</p>
  <p>-patient medical records</p>
  <p>-medical images</p>
  <p>-live two-way audio or video or both</p>
  <p>-output data from medical devices and sound and video files</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security 
    protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and 
    imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure 
    its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Responsibility for the patient care should remain with the patient’s local 
    clinician, if you have one, as does the patient’s medical record.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Expected Benefits:</p>
  <p>-Improved access to medical care by enabling a patient to remain in 
    his/her local healthcare site while the physician consults and obtains 
    test results at other sites</p>
  <p>-More efficient medical evaluation and management</p>
  <p>-Obtain immediate medical care access</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Possible risks:</p>
  <p>As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated 
    with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be 
    limited to:</p>
  <p>-In rare cases, the consultant may determine that the transmitted 
    information is of inadequate quality, thus necessitating a face-to-face 
    meeting with the patient, or at least a rescheduled video consult.</p>
  <p>-Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to 
    deficiencies or failures of the equipment</p>
  <p>-In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach 
    of privacy of personal medical information</p>
  <p>-In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result 
    in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors.</p>
